# Homework 10 SVG Logo Maker

## Description

I made a simple logo generator for my projects so I don't need to pay a graphic designer.

## Installation

Remember to type npm i on the command line in the generator directory to install Inquirer and inquirer-maxlenght-input  for the generator to work.

## Usage

N/A

To use the generator, type node index.js on the command line in the generator directory then you can start answering the questions to create a logo.
